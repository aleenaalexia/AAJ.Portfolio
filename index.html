        <p class="about-text">Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
        Let me begin by introducing myself... My name is Aleena Alexia Johns, 
        and I was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. Electronics have 
        always piqued my interest, as they have for most other children of 
        my generation. In my life, I've seen many incredible digital projects/websites 
        on the daily, and never realized how much time and effort went into each one.
        Creating my own projects has given me a whole new perspective on the 
        internet and the creators behind it all. To say I am interested in web 
        development is an understatement, and I hope this portfolio gives you 
        a taste of what I am capable of!</p>
