# AAJ.Portfolio

This week, I am starting my developer porfolio displaying all my projects, allowing users to contact me, and a link to my resume. I will continue to revise this portfolio in order to use it by the end of this bootcamp to potentially get interviews for future jobs. 

**Portfolio still a work in progress... Major layout revisions needed and applicable images are imperative.
